# Introduction #

Don't you wish at times to be able to address the content of your list or vector by a hash key too, vice versa? You wish to have the cake and eat it too. In fact, have both pies and eat them too - be able to positionally address hashed values in the order they were stored. This class provides such features.

# Details #

This class allows you to
  * put(key, value)
  * get(key)
